# BellyButton Dashboard
![mod12.png](PNGs/mod12.png)


## Overview

The assignment was based on a hypothetical biological researcher at a microbiology laboratory who wanted to discover and document bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. The researcher believes it can be found in the human body because it is a source of thousands of types of bacteria. 

The researcher hypothesizes that the ideal bacterial species to make synthetic beef may be found in the belly button. To test the hypothesis, navel samples were collected from people across the country. Each person is anonymous and were assigned and ID number. 

The goal was to create an attractive, accessible, and interactive dashboard using Plotly.js to explore data on biodiversity of belly buttons. It will then be deployed to a cloud server. JavaScript was used to create interactive features, such as buttons and dropdown menus. Data was retrieved from external sources using D3.json().


## Resources

The following resources were utilized to complete the assignment:

- Plotly.js 
- VS Code to create and edit HTML and JavaScript files
- Web browser console and localhost: 8000
- Mac terminal to run a local server
- GitHub Pages to deploy final data visualization


## Process

- Creation of basic plots, bar, line, and pie charts with Plotly
- D3.json() to fetch external data (CSVs, web APIs)
- Parse data in JSON format
- Used functional programming in JavaScript to manipulate data
- Used JavaScript's Math library to manipulate numbers
- Used event handlers in JavaScript to enhance interactivity
- Deployment of web page to GitHub Pages 

## Result
